Description:
    The favorite_model generator creates a Role model for use with the ActsAsFavorite plugin.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument, which at this time must be 'Favorite'.

    The generator creates a Role model class in app/models, a test suite in
    test/unit, test fixtures in test/fixtures/singular_name.yml, and a migration
    in db/migrate.

Example:
    ./script/generate favorite_model Favorite

    This will create a Role model:
        Model:      app/models/favorite.rb
        Test:       test/unit/favorite_test.rb
        Fixtures:   test/fixtures/favorites.yml
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_favorites.rb
        
    You should then run "rake migrate".
